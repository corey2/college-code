Homework #2

  This program is a client that is meant to show off the use
TeacherDate objects. It asks for the user's year, month, and 
day of birth, and uses this information to calculate the
number of days until their next birthday and how many days
they have lived altogether. The program also shows what day 
of the week the user was born on and if they were born on a 
leap year.
