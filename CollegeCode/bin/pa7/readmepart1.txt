  This folder contains Relatives.java, a program that creates
a family tree of ancestors and descendants given a text file of
people and a certain person in that file to use (such as
tudor.txt) as a starting point. It also contains Person.java, 
which takes each person makes an object out of them, and stores
their parents and children as fields.
