PA2: Part 1

  This folder contains several Java files that work together to
simulate the eating habits of various animals at ant hills. Animal.java is an abstract class which outlines various methods which allow users to determine or gather information about associated Animal objects. Animals are runnable threads, which means that many of them may be roaming around the Anthills at the same time. BasicAnthill.java is a specific implementation of Anthill.java, and represents the state of these Anthills. The program keeps track of the animals that are there at any given time as well as reporting this information whenever an Animal comes to or exits from an Anthill. Aardvark.java and Anteater.java represent the two species of animal that are allowed to enter Anthills. Aardvarks are faster and can even share an Anthill with two other Aardvarks. Test1 is the class with the main method that puts a scenario with all of these other objects into motion. PriorityScheduler.java allows certain animals to be allowed in an anthill before others. Test2 tests this added feature.
