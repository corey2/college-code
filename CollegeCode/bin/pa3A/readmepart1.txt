     This folder contains the code for a class called RegularTicket,
its subclasses, and a client program that demonstrates the capabilities 
of these classes. The regular ticket holds its identification number and
price as fields, and has methods to allow other programs to retrieve its
data and one that prints the data as a string. Its price must be 
initialized at $40. The Walkup Ticket is the same except it is 
initialized at $50 and can display its specific type. The Advance Ticket
is also very similar to the Regular Ticket, but it also stores the
number of days in advance it was purchased, and initializes a certain 
price based on this information. It can also print any information it 
contains. The Student Advance Ticket is an even more specific Advance
Ticket that initializes to half the price and prints out that ID is
required. The TestTicket program creates an array with various types of
tickets and prints out the information in each ticket when it is stored.
Additionally, it keeps track of the price of each ticket as the for-loop
iterates and displays the total price once the array is complete.
