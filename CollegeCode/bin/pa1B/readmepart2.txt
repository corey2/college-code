The two classes in this folder help to represent a 
shopping list that someone brings to the market.
GroceryItemOrder is the template for objects that 
hold the name of a market item, how many of this 
item the person has, and how much each unit of the
item costs. It also has a method that reveals the
"physical" content of the object. GroceryList is 
the template for objects that can hold an array of 
groceries and that has special methods to modify 
this array. One method allows inputs of grocery
items one at a time in order and the other finds
the total cost of everything that the user plans
to buy.
