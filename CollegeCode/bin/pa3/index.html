<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>
  In this project, you will supply modules that complete the design of
  a simple file system on top of a simulated disk. Your file system
  provides a standard seek/read/write interface and uses inodes and
  single-, double-, and triple-indirection to support large files
  (similar to the class UNIX file system model we learned in class).
</p>

<p>
  Your task is to add code for bitwise operations to complete the free
  space bitmap, and to add indirection to support files larger than 10
  blocks. There is a large amount of code provided to you in this
  project, so it will be important to pay attention to interfaces and
  boundaries between modules to avoid getting overwhelmed by the
  surrounding code as you add your solution.
</p>

<h2><a name="quickref">Quick Reference</a></h2>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>
  You will modify at least the following two files:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong class="filename">Bitwise.java</strong>.
    Finish the following methods using the bitmasks:
    <ul>
      <li>public static byte set(int i, byte b)</li>
      <li>public static void set(int i, byte bytes[])</li>
      <li>public static byte clear(int i, byte b)</li>
      <li>public static boolean clear(int i, byte bytes[])</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong class="filename">MyFileSystem.java</strong>.  Modify
    <strong class="code">getDirectBlock</strong> to support large
     files using single-, double-, and triple-indirection.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="warning">
  You may not modify the following files without first getting
  permission from your TA:
  <ul>
    <li>FileSystem.java</li>
    <li>Shell.java</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  You may modify and create other classes / files at your discretion.
</p>

<h3><a name="expected-behavior">Expected Behavior</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support large files with single-, double-, and triple-indirection</li>
  <li>Allow holes in files</li>
  <li>Pass the tests provided in test_data, Test1.java, Test2.java,
  and the test embedded in MyFileSystem.java</li>
  <li>Work even if constants are changed (such as 
  &quot;buying a bigger disk,&quot; i.e., changing Disk.NUM_BLOCKS)
</ul>

<p>
  This list is not a substitute for reading the entire assignment and
  asking questions.
</p>

<h2><a name="system-documentation">System Documentation</a></h2>

<p>
  The file system with which you will be working has a fairly large
  codebase, including modules for creating a simulated disk,
  representing different types of disk blocks, and managing free
  space, as well as the file system itself. You will want to utilize
  the following references in addition to familiarizing yourself with
  the source code:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="system-design">Design Overview</a></li>
  <li><a href="src/doc">API reference</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="your-tasks">Your Tasks</a></h2>

<h3><a name="getting-the-code">Getting the Code</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Download the source code archive <a href="pa3.zip">pa3.zip</a>
  and unpack it wherever you like.</li>
  <li>Review all the files, making note of the following (this is not
  a complete manifest, but describes some of the files that are most
  important for you to understand first):
    <ul>
      <li>You can ignore the folders <strong class="filename">org</strong> and
        <strong class="filename">junit</strong>. They are an unpacked
        <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> distribution used by
      the unit tests. You don't need to know how JUnit works, nor do
      you need to look in these directories. They are here for your
      convenience if you want to run the provided tests.</li>
      <li><strong class="filename">FileSystem.java</strong> contains
      the File System interface. The Shell and unit tests assume that
      MyFileSystem implements FileSystem. You may <strong>not</strong>
      modify FileSystem.java or make MyFileSystem implement a
      different interface.</li>
      <li><strong class="filename">MyFileSystem.java</strong> contains
      an implementation of the FileSystem interface. You will
      implement indirection to support large files in this file. This
      file includes a static nested top-level
      class <strong class="code">DirectBlock</strong> which is of
      importance when
      implementing <strong class="code">getDirectBlock</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong class="filename">Bitwise.java</strong> contains a
      utility class for doing bitwise operations. You will make some
      small additions in this file to fix the free map.</li>
      <li><strong class="filename">FreeMap.java</strong> contains an
      implementation of a free space bitmap that is stored both in the
      SuperBlock and in other free space bitmap <em>blocks</em>. You
      will not need to modify the FreeMap but you need to understand
      how it works, especially the
      methods <span class="code">find()</span>, <span class="code">clear(int
      blockNum)</span>, and <span class="code">save()</span>.</li>
      <li><strong class="filename">Shell.java</strong> a basic shell
      that can interact with any FileSystem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Review what changes you have to make and how to test them.
    <ul>
      <li>Fix the Bitwise operations and test it by running
        <pre class="shell">javac Bitwise.java && java Bitwise</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Test your changes with TestBitwise.java</li>
      <li>Run the Shell and test the File System:
        <pre class="shell">javac Shell.java && java Shell</pre>
        notice that it crashes if you try to write to a large file
      </li>
      <li>Add indirection in MyFileSystem</li>
      <li>Use TestMyFileSystem.java to check for regressions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="freemap">Fix Bitwise</a></h3>

<p>
  The FreeMap class is already implemented for you. FreeMap relies on
  methods from the Bitwise utility class. A few methods in Bitwise are
  unfinished and require you to implement them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>public static byte set(int i, byte b) {}</li>
  <li>public static void set(int i, byte bytes[]) {}</li>
  <li>public static byte clear(int i, byte b) {}</li>
  <li>public static boolean clear(int i, byte bytes[]) {}</li>
</ul>

<p>
  See the javadoc comments
  in <a href="src/Bitwise.java"><span class="filename">Bitwise.java</span></a>
  for more information about these methods. Remember that
  &quot;setting&quot; a bit means set it to <b>1</b>, while
  &quot;clearing&quot; a bit means clear it to
  <b>0</b>.
</p>

<p>
  You cannot use the standard assignment and indexing operators to
  which you are accustomed in Java when you want to access bits; the
  smallest unit you can directly address is a byte. So, you must use
  bitwise operators on bytes to test the values of bits. For your
  assignment, the bitmap will be stored as a byte array. You may want
  to brush up on <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">bitwise
  operators</a> and their use <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html">in
  java</a>. An important point to remember is that in Java, all types
  are signed, even bytes. You may have to take the sign bit into
  account depending on what operations you use for manipulating the
  bytes in the bitmap.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  You may not use <span class="code">java.util.BitSet</span> or any
  other bit-manipulation classes available on Internet. You also may
  not &quot;simulate&quot; a bitmap using an array of booleans. You
  must write your own code for reading and writing the bitmap, and it
  must pack the free status for 8 blocks into each byte.
</p>

<h3><a name="indirection">Indirect Blocks</a></h3>

<p>
  PA3 does not support indirection &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;. Finding
  the block that contains a byte offset in the file is implemented in
  the following utility function in MyFileSystem:
</p>

<pre class="code">/**
 * Get a DirectBlock object representing the direct block given
 * the current seek position in the open file identified by fd. A
 * DirectBlock references the direct block and offset within that
 * block containing the current seek position.
 *
 * If the current seek position is within a hole or beyond the end
 * of a file, then if create is true then a block will be
 * allocated to fill the hole. If there is no more free space in
 * the file system, null will be returned. If the seek position is
 * in a hole and create is false, then a block containing zeroes
 * will be returned.
 *
 * @param   fd          valid file descriptor of an open file
 * @param   mode        MODE.w if holes should be filled, MODE.r
 *                      otherwise (holes will be read as blocks
 *                      of all zeros)
 * @returns DirectBlock block and offset in that block where the
 *                      seek position of fd can be found
 */
private DirectBlock getDirectBlock(int fd, MODE mode) {
}</pre>

<p>
  In the code provided to you, this function works correctly for the
  first 10 blocks of the file. Accessing bytes in a logical block
  number higher than 10 will cause the program to crash. It is up to
  you to use single-, double-, and triple-indirect blocks to solve
  this problem. You can read about how indirect pointers work
  at <a href="system-design/#file-structure">System Design: File
  Structure</a>.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  The purpose of the <span class="code">mode</span> parameter is to
  allow getDirectBlock to work when writing to holes or beyond the end
  of a file. Remember that when writing to blocks that are only
  accessible through indirect blocks, those indirect blocks may need
  to be allocated along with the direct block where the actual file
  data is stored.
</p>

<h3><a name="implementation-notes">Implementation Notes</a></h3>

<p>
  You may add a new abstraction layer to represent the search for
  direct blocks, or perhaps a set of direct blocks accessed in a
  range. Whether or not this simplifies the task in your mind is up to
  you. However, be careful not to make the project more complex than
  it needs to be. Your goal is to avoid having to rewrite existing
  code, and instead add a relatively small amount of new code that
  adds an important new feature.
</p>

<h2><a name="testing">Testing</a></h2>

<h3><a name="unit-tests">Unit Tests</a></h3>

<p>
  Included with the PA3 code are unit tests for MyFileSystem and
  Bitwise:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TestMyFileSystem.java</li>
  <li>TestBitwise.java</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Running the unit tests is a good idea if you change the provided
  code significantly. Feel free to add new unit tests if you wish. The
  unit test files have instructions on how to run them (using JUnit,
  which is provided as part of the PA3 code). By the way, from a
  technical standpoint these tests are closer to "integration" tests
  than unit tests, because they do not test methods in complete
  isolation, but I'm calling them unit tests since they at least
  approximate the spirit of modular testing.
</p>

<p>
  Note that TestMyFileSystem currently does not have any tests for
  large files. You may wish to write your own as you work on
  developing and debugging large file support (single-, double-, and
  triple-indirection).
</p>

<h3><a name="command-interpreter">The Command Interpreter</a></h3>

<p>
  The <span class="code">main</span> method in class <span
  class="code">Shell</span> implements a simple command interpreter
  that is useful for testing your file system.  You can either use it
  interactively by invoking the program as:
</p>

<pre class="shellcode">java Shell</pre>

<p>
  or you can have it run a test script by typing, for example:
</p>

<pre class="shellcode">java Shell test_data/test1.data</pre>

<p>
  Input lines starting with "/*" or "//" are ignored (the latter are
  echoed to the output). Other lines have the format:
</p>

<pre class="code">[ var = ] command [ args ]</pre>

<p>
  The optional prefix <span class="code">var =</span> causes the
  result of the command to be assigned to a variable.  In any case,
  the result of the command is printed.  The there is one command for
  each of the ten methods of class <span
  class="code">FileSystem</span> as well as three additional commands:
  <span class="code">help</span>, <span class="code">vars</span>, and
  <span class="code">quit</span>.  The <span class="code">help</span>
  command prints a list of commands, the <span
  class="code">vars</span> command lists the current values of all
  interpreter variables that have been assigned values, and the <span
  class="code">quit</span> command terminates the program.  With the
  exception of the second argument to <span class="code">write</span>,
  each argument can be either an integer or the name of a variable.
  The command:
</p>

<pre class="code">write fd pattern size</pre>

<p>
  writes <span class="code">size</span> bytes to the indicated file at
  the current offset.  The data is generated by repeating <span
  class="code">pattern</span> over and over the required number of
  times.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Most of the tests in test_data will not work until you implement
  large file support. test_data/test1.data is an exception.
