Homework #2

  The first item this folder contains is a Date class that is used to
generate objects which hold a certain date based on the parameters 
they are passed. Each object has several methods that can be 
used to figure out additional information about the date it 
holds. First, there are the basic accessor (get) methods, and
ones that allow the object to print itself or compare itself
to another object to see if it has the same contents. Some of the 
more unusual method purposes include finding the day of the week the 
date falls on, figuring out if the date falls on a leap year, and 
advancing the date forward by one day while accounting for the 
gregorian calandar. Finally, there is a default constructor which
automatically stores today's date in the object.
  The second item is a client class, Birthday2, that uses the Date object to 
find and display information about the users birthday. It is 
effectively identical to the Birthday class found in the other folder.
