  COSI 31a: Fall 2013
  <div id="subtitle">Programming Assignment 2</div>
</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Your task is to implement a simulation of anthills and ant-eating animals using
  Java Threads. There will be few anthills, but many animals. There
  will be several constraints on how many animals of each type can be
  eating at an anthill at the same time. After you implement this
  primary system, you will implement a higher-level anthill controller
  that will schedule access to the anthills based on a priority system.
</p>

<p>
  The project is split into 2 required tasks and 1 extra-credit
  task. Task 1 requires you to use the synchronized keyword to prevent
  race conditions. Task 2 requires you to build on your synchronized
  code and add monitors to avoid busy-waiting and add a scheduler. The
  extra credit task asks you to use monitors to make the scheduler
  preemptive.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Task 1 has an earlier due date than Task 2 and the extra-credit
  assignment. See LATTE for due dates.
</p>

<h2>Anthill Description</h2>

<p>
  Any implementation of the Anthill interface must satisfy the
  following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only three aardvarks may eat at an anthill at any given time.</li>
  <li>Only one anteater may eat at an anthill at any given time.</li>
  <li>Anteaters and aardvarks cannot eat at the same anthill at the same time.</li>
  <li>Anthills have a limited number of ants and an animal cannot try to eat an ant from an empty anthill</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As you know from learning about concurrency, without proper
  synchronization, these constraints could be violated since a thread
  may secure permission to eat at an anthill, then be interrupted before
  it can actually go to the anthill, at which point another thread may also secure
  permission to eat at the anthill and do so. When the first thread to
  get permission to eat at the anthill does so, one of the invariants
  may be violated (e.g., maybe an anteater and aardvark will be eating at the same anthill at
  the same time).
</p>

<p>
  Part of your job in this assignment is to use synchronization to
  prevent such race conditions from occurring regardless of
  scheduling.
</p>

<h2>Code provided to you</h2>

<p class="warning">
  You must use and may <emph>not</emph> modify any of these files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="Animal.java">Animal.java</a></li>
  <li><a href="Aardvark.java">Aardvark.java</a></li>
  <li><a href="Anteater.java">Anteater.java</a></li>
  <li><a href="Anthill.java">Anthill.java</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>API Docs</h3>

<p>
  You will need to understand how all provided code works to solve
  this problem, even though you will not be allowed to modify it in
  tasks 1 and 2. You will want to inspect the java files yourself, but
  to get you started here are the <a href="api">API docs</a> generated
  with javadoc from the files provided with PA2.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
  Here is an example of running an Aardvark in a thread that can eat at a
  single anthill. This example will not work until you have written the
  BasicAnthill class:
  <pre class="code">public class TestAardvark {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Anthill anthill = new BasicAnthill("0", 10); // you must write BasicAnthill
        new Thread(new Aardvark("0-Aardvark", anthill)).start();
    }
}</pre>
  This simple example should output the following given a correct
  implementation of BasicAnthill:
  <pre class="output">0-Aardvark has started eating at 0 with priority 0
0-Aardvark has eaten from 0 with priority 0</pre>
</p>

<h2>Important Note about Disallowed Java Tools</h2>

<p>
  In PA1, you were instructed to consider using a synchronized class
  provided by Java for inter-thread communication (BlockingQueue)
  to solve the problem. For this project, that is <strong>not
  allowed</strong>; you may not use <strong>any</strong> synchronized
  data structure included in the Java API. You must write your own
  (using the &quot;synchronized&quot; keyword). Of course, you can and
  should use non-synchronized data structures in the Java standard
  library. You can consult the API docs to see if a data structure is
  synchronized.
</p>

<p>
  You also <strong>may not</strong> use the thread priority methods
  provided by Java (e.g., you may not use Thread.setPriority).
</p>

<h2>Task 1: The Basic Anthill</h2>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
  You must create a class called BasicAnthill (in a file called
  BasicAnthill.java) that implements the interface Anthill, and then
  within that class carry out the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enforce the Anthill Restrictions described above.</li>
  <li>
    Use the Java synchronized keyword to prevent race conditions
    (without introducing deadlock).
  </li>
  <li>
    Display the following output when an animal successfully starts eating at an
    anthill:
    <pre class="code">&lt;animal-name&gt; has started eating at &lt;anthill-name&gt; with priority &lt;p&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Display the following output when an animal successfully leaves an
    anthill:
    <pre class="code">&lt;animal-name&gt; has eaten at &lt;anthill-name&gt; with priority &lt;p&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The debug output never shows animals having eaten before they have
    started eating, failing to eat after they have started eating, eating from a
    different anthill from the one they started eating at, or any other
    unexpected behavior.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Required Test</h3>

<p>
  You are required to implement (and turn in as part of your project)
  a class called Test1 (in Test1.java) with a main method (so it can
  be run from the command line) which carries out the following test:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create 4 BasicAnthills (with 50 ants each), 150 Aardvarks, and 50 Anteaters</li>
  <li>
    Name Animals according the code &quot;n-type&quot; where
    &quot;n&quot; is a unique number from 0 &#8211; 199 (unique over
    all animals whether they are an Aardvark or an Anteater),
    &quot;type&quot; is either Aardvark or Anteater.  I.e., Aardvarks are named
    &quot;0-Aardvark&quot; through &quot;149-Aardvark&quot; and Anteaters are named
    &quot;150-Anteater&quot; through &quot;199-Anteater&quot;.
  </li>
  <li>
    Name Anthills with consecutive numbers starting from 0 (so the
    first anthill is named "0", the second is named "1", and so on).
  </li>
  <li>
    Start the Animals in the following order:
    <ol>
      <li>50 Aardvarks</li>
      <li>50 Anteaters</li>
      <li>100 Aardvarks</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Task 2: The Priority Scheduler</h2>

<p>
<em>Remember:</em> You also <strong>may not</strong> use the thread priority methods
  provided by Java (e.g., you may not use Thread.setPriority).
</p>


<p>
  You have now successfully programmed BasicAnthill which enforces
  entry criteria and prevents race conditions. However, there are two
  problems with the design of BasicAnthill:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    While no anthill is available to an Animal, that Animal busy-waits
    (loops over all anthills repeatedly inside of its run() method).
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no way of prioritizing important animals (say, a queen)
    over less-important animals (say, a drone).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Defined</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Priority is a number between 0 and 4 (inclusive).</li>
  <li>A higher number means higher priority.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>
  You must create a class called PriorityScheduler (in
  PriorityScheduler.java) that implements Anthill and controls access
  to a collection of Anthills in order to implement the priority
  scheduling policy described above. The Anthills &quot;behind&quot;
  the PriorityScheduler will be BasicAnthills. BasicAnthill should be
  the same class you implemented for the first part of this project.
</p>

<p>
  PriorityScheduler will carry out the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Keep references to BasicAnthills as private member variables inside
    PriorityScheduler.
  </li>
  <li>
    When an Animal calls tryToEatAtWithAnimal(animal) on a PriorityScheduler
    instance, the following algorithm should be run:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>If</dt>
          <dd>
            animal.getPriority() &lt; the highest priority from among
            all the other animals waiting to eat at an anthill (i.e.,
            there is another animal with higher priority),
          </dd>
          <dt>or</dt>
          <dd>
            there are no other animals with higher priority but there
            are no anthills which the animal can currently eat at,
          </dd>
          <dt>then</dt>
          <dd>
            the animal thread must wait;
          </dd>
          <dt>otherwise</dt>
          <dd>
            the animal successfully starts eating at one of the anthills.
          </dd>
        </dl>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When an Animal a exits the scheduler by calling exitAnthillWithAnimal on a
    PriorityScheduler instance, the scheduler must call exitAnthillWithAnimal(a)
    on the appropriate anthill from the collection of anthills managed
    by the scheduler (remember, you may <strong>not</strong> modify
    Animal or any of the other classes provided to you, or
    BasicAnthill, so you must solve this problem within
    PriorityScheduler).
  </li>
  <li>
    Use monitors to avoid busy-waiting if an animal cannot find an
    anthill to eat at.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maximize concurrency by synchronizing only where necessary.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Required Test</h3>

<p>
  You are required to implement (and turn in as part of your project)
  a class called Test2 (in Test2.java) with a main method (so it can
  be run from the command line) which carries out the following test:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create 150 aardvarks and 50 anteaters, 2 BasicAnthills, and 1
    PriorityScheduler which manages the 2 BasicAnthills.
  </li>
  <li>Name the Animals and Anthills just as in Test1.</li>
  <li>
    Assign priority (n mod 5) to each Animal (where &quot;n&quot; is
    the unique number 0 &#8211; 199 also used to help name the
    Animals).
    <ul>
      <li>Remember, this means all Animals have priority 0 &#8211; 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Start the Animals in the same order as Test1</li>
</ol>

<h2>Extra Credit: Preemptive Scheduler</h2>

<p class="warning">
  This task is <strong>not</strong> required. If you choose to do it,
  it will be worth 10% extra credit. Please do not attempt it until
  you are confident that tasks 1 and 2 are implemented
  correctly. Please run your design idea by the TA before you start
  coding the extra credit portion.
</p>

<p>
  Your extra credit task is to modify your scheduler to be
  preemptive. In order to do this, you are allowed to modify the
  doWhileAtAnthill method and the constructors of the Animal
  class. The new scheduler class must be called
  PreemptivePriorityScheduler.
</p>

<h3>Premption Rules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The highest priority value (4) will be reserved for Exterminators
  </li>
  <li>
    An Exterminator may eat at an anthill with any other animals (including
    an anteater) <strong>except</strong> another Exterminator (i.e., the only
    time an exterminator must wait is if there is already an exterminator at
    all anthills).
  </li>
  <li>
    Any time an exterminator wants to eat at an anthill, any animals at
    that anthill must immediately pull back and wait for the exterminator
    to do her/his job and leave the anthill. That is, the animals cannot
    make progress while the Exterminator is
    at the anthill.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once an exterminator leaves the anthill, animals at the anthill start
    making progress again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exterminators do <strong>NOT</strong> decrement the count of ants (they're terrible exterminators).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Add new animal type Exterminator with the fastest possible speed.
  </li>
    Modify Exterminator.doWhileAtAnthill as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use monitors to avoid busy-waiting while an exterminator is at an
        anthill.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use wait(timeout) where the timeout is the same as the
        parameter to Thread.sleep in the implementation provided to
        you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Think carefully about what object to lock (remember, a
        synchronized method locks &quot;this&quot;). You may modify
        the Animal constructor (or add a new field and setter/getter)
        if you wish for the purpose of referencing another object to
        synchronize on.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Here is an example of how Animals wait on an exterminator:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Say an animal takes 100 ms at an anthill, and has currently
        been there for 50 ms
      </li>
      <li>
        When it is notified that an exterminator is eating at its anthill,
        it waits indefinitely for the exterminator to leave the anthill
      </li>
      <li>
        When the exterminator notifies it that it has left the anthill,
        the animal begins its timeout wait again, using whatever time
        was remaining on the clock from when it was woken up the first
        time by the exterminator. In other words, the animal calls
        wait(50).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Required Test</h3>

<p>
  You are responsible for writing a test which exercises . Be sure to include enough simultaneous
  Exterminator threads that sometimes an Exterminator will have to wait.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<h3>instanceof operator</h3>

<p>
  You might find
  the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html">instanceof
  operator</a> (scroll down a bit on the page that links to)
  helpful. instanceof can tell you if an object can be downcast from a
  parent type into a child type. Typically, we don't use it because
  there are better techniques (polymorphism leverages the type system
  to do the work for you), but for this problem it will probably help
  you out.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example:
  <pre class="code">public class TestInstanceof {
    public static class Parent {
    }
    public static class Child1 extends Parent {
    }
    public static class Child2 extends Parent {
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p1 = new Child1();
        Parent p2 = new Child2();

        if(p1 instanceof Child1) {
            System.out.println("p1 is instance of Child1");
        }
        if(p1 instanceof Child2) {
            System.out.println("p1 is instance of Child2");
        }
        if(p2 instanceof Child1) {
            System.out.println("p2 is instance of Child1");
        }
        if(p2 instanceof Child2) {
            System.out.println("p2 is instance of Child2");
        }
    }
}</pre>
  This outputs:
  <pre class="output">p1 is instance of Child1
p2 is instance of Child2</pre>
</p>

<h3>synchronized blocks</h3>

<p>
  The following two uses of the synchronized keyword are equivalent:
  <pre class="code">public synchronized void m() {
    // ...
}</pre>
  <pre class="code">public void m() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // ...
    }
}</pre>
  If you want to synchronize the whole method on the lock contained
  inside of &quot;this&quot;, then it is more elegant to put the
  synchronized keyword in the signature of the method.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want to synchronize on smaller blocks of code than an
  entire method. This allows you to limit the amount of
  synchronization, which can improve performance by <strong>maximizing
  concurrency</strong>. In this case, putting synchronized in its own
  block can be the better choice.
  <pre class="code">public void m() {
    // a non-critical section
    synchronized(this) {
        // a critical section
    }
    // a non-critical section
    synchronized(this) {
        // a critical section
    }
    // a non-critical section
}</pre>
</p>

<p>
  Note that you can synchronize on the lock in any instance, not just
  &quot;this&quot;. For example:
  <pre class="code">public class C {
    private static Object o = new Object();

    public void m() {
        synchronized(o) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}</pre>
  You might not need to synchronize on an instance other than
  &quot;this&quot; for this project.
</p>
